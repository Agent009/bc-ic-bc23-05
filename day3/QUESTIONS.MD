# Motoko Bootcamp 2023 - Day 3 Question Answers

### 1. True or False: the Internet Computer has a unique public key that can be used to verify responses coming from any subnets.

* **True**
* Each **subnet** has its own **static public key**.
* * Each **node** in the **subnet** has their own share of the **subnet**'s **public key**.
* All **subnets** orchestrated by the special **NNS** subnet, which has its own **public key**, and certifies all subnet keys.
* So, essentially, despite thousands of nodes and subnets, all that's really needed is the **single public key** of the **NNS**.

#### Resources Used

- [Inside the Internet Computer | Chain Key Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUcDRFC09J0) - describes the **Chain-Key Technology** and how it all revolves around a single public key (around 5 minute mark).

### 2. True or False: when I realize an update call, the boundary node will participate in the consensus but not during query calls.

* **True**
* Query calls do not go through consensus

### 3. True or False: I can create a certified variable that will certify the response of the following actor:

* **True**
* Certified variables can be set during an update call to a canister, when the canister changes its state during a transaction that went through consensus.
* The certificate can then be read in a subsequent query call, so the canister can respond to a client's request in a trustworthy way but without incurring the additional delay of consensus.
